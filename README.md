### 1.1 Installation and Setup
*To pull this repository to your local machine, start by creating a local repository and depending on your operating system, install an appropriate git file on your local drive. You will first need to create a local copy of the project on your local machine. To do this, navigate to the location where you want to setup your local repository using the command line and create an empty folder. You might want to use the same name as name of project. Next, create a cloud GitHub account by going to;*

[GitHub](http://github.com). 

*Access will be granted upon your creation of a GitHub account and you should be able to spot the project name in your account. To get started, head back to your working directory and navigate to the empty folder you created. Install and set up the following*

- [Latest versuin of VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
